## 🎯 Objective

To design and deploy a comprehensive network system that supports:

- VLAN-based segmentation for departments  
- Dynamic IP allocation using DHCP  
- Secure remote access via SSH  
- Optimized routing using OSPF  
- Wireless and wired user connectivity  
- Integrated services like HTTP and Email

## 🧩 Key Features & Implementation

### 🔹 1. Hierarchical Network Design
- Structured in core, distribution, and access layers for scalability and ease of management.

### 🔹 2. VLAN Segmentation
- Each department is assigned its own VLAN for improved security and traffic isolation.

### 🔹 3. IP Addressing & Subnetting
- Subnets calculated based on host requirements.
- Includes subnet masks, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges.

### 🔹 4. Dynamic IP Allocation
- DHCP servers provide automatic IP assignment to all devices.

### 🔹 5. Secure Remote Access (SSH)
- SSH configured on all routers for encrypted admin access.

### 🔹 6. Routing Protocol (OSPF)
- OSPF is used to advertise routes and enable efficient communication between departments.

### 🔹 7. Port Security
- Port security implemented on switches using the sticky MAC method to prevent unauthorized access.

### 🔹 8. Wireless Connectivity
- Each department is equipped with wireless access points to enable mobility and flexibility.

### 🔹 9. Server Configuration
- **Email Server**: For internal and client communication  
- **HTTP Server**: For internal banking services and document access

### 🔹 10. Testing & Verification
- Network functionality, security protocols, DHCP, routing, and server configurations are verified through simulations and ping tests.
